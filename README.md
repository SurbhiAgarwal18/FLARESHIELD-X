FlareSafe Wallet — Self-Defending Smart Wallet on Flare Coston2

FlareSafe Wallet is an advanced security-focused smart contract deployed on the Flare Coston2 Testnet.
It introduces on-chain automated protection mechanisms that safeguard user funds from risky transactions, suspicious behavior, unauthorized access, and accidental transfers.
The project demonstrates how blockchain logic can enforce self-protection, role-based controls, and transaction monitoring without relying solely on private keys.

⭐ Key Highlights

Automated freeze protection triggered by high-risk behavior

Guardian-based human oversight for emergency freezing

Time-locked unfreeze for enhanced safety

Configurable protection parameters

Full frontend integration with MetaMask using Ethers.js

A complete demonstration of secure smart-contract wallet design

🛡️ Security Features
1. Auto-Freeze System

The wallet automatically freezes when it detects:

High-value transfers

Transfers to risky addresses

Rapid repeated transactions (draining attempts)

Transfers to untrusted addresses while Safe Mode is enabled

2. Manual & Guardian Controls

Owner Manual Freeze: Instant panic protection

Guardian Freeze: Additional human safeguard

Time-Locked Unfreeze: Prevents immediate reactivation after freezing

3. Configurable Protection Settings

The owner can update:

High-value threshold

Risky addresses

Trusted addresses

Safe Mode

Timelock duration

Rapid transaction limits

Guardian wallet address
